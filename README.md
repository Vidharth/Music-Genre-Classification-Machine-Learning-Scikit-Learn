# Dependencies
* Python 3.6 is the first version of Python that allows for f-strings, which we use in our code.
If you do not have Python 3.6 yet -- check with ```python3 --version```, if you have Ubuntu 16.04 or later, you can easily install
Python 3.6 by using the following commands:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

* Numpy and Pandas are used to handle our data. Scikit-Learn is used for the actual Machine Learning. Install the latest versions with the following commands:
```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install sklearn
```

# Usage
Once all the dependencies have been installed, you can run the program by calling:
```python3 main.py```
